                <p>
                    I think it is a very complete and interesting language as
                    well as simple but effective. Sometimes I was surprised at
                    how easy it was to find a solution to a problem because Ruby
                    practically takes care of doing everything below without the
                    need to create custom methods.

                    Ruby?</h1>
                <p class=" section-sm">
                    I had a hard time understanding how the code blocks work;
                    however, once I started developing and proposing solutions
                    using this Ruby functionality, I realized that it is quite
                    functional and effective. In addition to that it is one of
                    the functions that allow this language to be so simple when
                    coding.

                    Surprisingly what cost me the most work, in the end it
                    became what I ended up using the most to code

                    most about Ruby?</h1>
                <p>
                    I loved that it is not necessary to open parentheses to send
                    parameters to the methods, until now I have not worked with
                    another language that has this peculiarity that I thought
                    was really cool.
